# Git challenge

## Part 1

Let's put into practice everything learned in this lesson by working on a practical example.

**Please answer all the questions in the `README.md` of your project below each of them.**

1.  Clone this repository on your local machine and push it to a new repository on your github account. Once you are done, copy your repository URL into the box provided on the learning platform.

2.  Create a new branch "feature-a"

    a. Create a commit updating the user's personal data with your own data (name, country, studies, etc). Push this commit.

    b. Change the nav bar left icons for text links. Don't commit.

3.  While you were working on the previous change, you are asked to immediately work on something else, so you need to leave your work in progress for later. This code isn't ready to be committed yet, so you want to **stash** it.

4.  Create another branch from main named "feature-b"

    a. Create a commit updating the hero background image.

    b. Create another commit updating the user name.

    c. Create another commit updating the text of the footer.

    d. Push all previous commits

5.  Merge "feature-b" into main. While you were working on your branch, other devs may have merged their work into the main branch, so before merging your code, you should try to get the latest version.

    a. What commands would you use and why?

    b. What merge method would you use and why?

6.  Now you want to go back to continue with the code stashed in step 3. Commit and push your previously stashed changes into `feature-a.`

7. You have now finished with your code from feature-a.

    a. Create a PR in order to merge `feature-a` into main.

    b. Conflicts happened? Solve them and prefer your code.

    c. Commit the conflict resolution changes to `feature-a` and update the PR with this commit.
